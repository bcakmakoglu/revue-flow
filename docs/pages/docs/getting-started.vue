    Vue Flow, just like React Flow, is a library for building node-based applications. These can be simple static diagrams or
    complex node-based editors. You can implement custom node types and edge types and it comes with components like a mini-map
    and graph controls. Feel free to check out the <router-link to="/examples">examples</router-link>.

# Welcome to Vue Flow!

Vue Flow is a bridge to the world of interactive flowcharts and graphs, empowering you to bring dynamism and
interactivity to flowcharts and graphic representations.
Whether it's crafting personal diagrams, generating dynamic editors, or anything else your imagination conjures up, Vue
Flow is your creative companion.

Vue Flow makes it effortless to customize and extend basic functionalities by allowing the integration of your own
bespoke nodes and edges.
Additional components such as Background, Minimap, and Controls further enrich the interface,
transforming your creations into engaging platforms.

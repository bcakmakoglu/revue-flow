# Introduction

Vue Flow is a library for building node-based applications. These can be simple static diagrams or complex node-based
editors. You can implement custom nodes and edges. It also comes with components like a mini-map, viewport controls and
a background. 

Check out the [examples](/examples/) if you want to dive directly into the code.

# Interaction

Vue Flow provides options to interact and limit interaction with the viewport and graph.
This includes enabling/disabling zoom-scroll, pan-scroll, dragging etc.

In the sandbox below you can find an example showing you how to toggle interaction options.

<div class="mt-6">
  <ClientOnly>
    <Suspense>
      <Repl example="interaction"></Repl>
    </Suspense>
  </ClientOnly>
</div>

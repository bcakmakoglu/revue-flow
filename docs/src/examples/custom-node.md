# Custom Node

One of the key features of Vue Flow is implementing custom elements (nodes / edges) that allow you to expand on the basic functionalities (dragging, selecting etc).

You can display any content and functionality inside a custom node. More documentation about how to set
up a custom node can be found on the [custom nodes page](/guide/node.html#custom-nodes).

<div class="mt-6">
  <client-only>
    <Suspense>
      <Repl example="customNode"></Repl>
    </Suspense>
  </client-only>
</div>

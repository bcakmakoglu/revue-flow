# Math Operation

This example demonstrates how to use the different composables like `useHandleConnections` or `useNodesData` to create a data flow between nodes.

In this example we use nodes to create a simple math operation, where the user can input two numbers and select an operation to perform.

<div class="mt-6">
  <Repl example="math"></Repl>
</div>

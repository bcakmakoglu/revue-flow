# Horizontal Layout

Vue Flow doesn't require you to use vertical layouts.
You can use horizontal layouts with the default node types as well.

You can define where source or target handle positions are with the `sourcePosition` or `targetPosition` properties of nodes.

<div class="mt-6">
  <client-only>
    <Suspense>
      <Repl example="horizontal"></Repl>
    </Suspense>
  </client-only>
</div>
